To use N-BEATS for stock price prediction, you can follow a similar approach as before. Here's a general outline of the steps:

Prepare Data:

Load historical Stock price data. You may use libraries like pandas to handle the data.
Normalize the data using MinMaxScaler.
Build N-BEATS Model:

Define the N-BEATS architecture. You can reuse the simple_nbeats function provided earlier.
Adjust the parameters such as backcast_length, forecast_length, num_blocks, and units based on your preference.
Compile and Train Model:

Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
Train the model using historical Stock price data. Split the data into training and testing sets.
Evaluate the Model:

Evaluate the model on the test set and analyze its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on future Stock prices.
